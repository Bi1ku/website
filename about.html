        I'm Owen Shi, a current sophomore at Stuyvesant High School, interested
        in STEM. I was born in Queens, New York, on April 13th, 2008, and raised
        by a traditional Chinese household. At 5, I moved to Greensboro, North
        Carolina, where I went to elemetary school (shoutout to Claxton
        Elemetary!). There, I lived for 6 years, helping my parents in our
        family restaurant and playing video games--enjoying life.

        However, due to parental conflicts, I moved back to New York City during
        my 5th-grade summer, attending I.S. 5, Walter H. Crowley Middle School,
        a school in Queens. I was a bit of a loner, but I made a few friends. I
        was also a bit of a troublemaker, but a decent student. During the
        pandemic, which happened at the end of my 6th-grade year, I began to
        learn to program, which quite literally changed my life. 8th grade went
        smoothly and I went to Townsend Harris High School before transferring
        to Stuyvesant due to their superior STEM programs. my favorite classes
        are Annual Introduction to Computer Science and Physics right now. I'm
        currently really enjoying my time here, and it's been a great
        experience!
        <br />
        <br />
        I live in Woodside, Queens, with my mother and grandmother in a small
        house. My aunt and cousins live down the block, so it's really
        convenient. Though I do miss Greensboro's large houses and flourishing
        nature, I love New York's hustle culture and mentality which motivate me
        to work harder each and every day!
